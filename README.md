# End-to-End Speech-to-Speech Translation

This repository contains our work on building an **End-to-End Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) system** with a focus on Indic languages.  
The goal of this project is to enable **direct speech translation across low-resource languages**, bypassing intermediate text transcription where possible.

## Key Highlights
- End-to-End pipeline for Speech-to-Speech Translation  
- Focus on **Indic languages** (low-resource setting)  
- Exploration of **SSM-based encoders (Audio Mamba)** and **textless models**  


## Repository Structure
- `models/` – Model architectures and training scripts  
- `datasets/` – Dataset preparation and preprocessing pipelines  
- `experiments/` – Experiment tracking and evaluation scripts  
- `notebooks/` – Research and exploratory work  
- `results/` – Logs, evaluation metrics, and plots  

## Motivation
Speech-to-Speech Translation is crucial for bridging communication gaps in multilingual societies like India.  
By directly mapping **speech in one language to speech in another**, this project pushes toward **real-time, long-form, and low-resource translation systems**.
